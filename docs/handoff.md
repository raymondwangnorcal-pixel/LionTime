## Current Goal

Origin-ID: origin-b22132f6aa5678840b05cd1a
Text: Render Uris Pool as a Dodge View spaces subsection without changing its independent live-data path.

## Accomplished in Latest Material Session

Origin-ID: origin-b22132f6aa5678840b05cd1a
Text: Nested Uris Pool as the fifth visible Dodge space, removed its duplicate top-level Fitness card and counts, retained embedded fallback hours and independent live hydration, preserved Uris search discovery, documented the product policy, and committed the implementation and decision lifecycle update.

## Risks / Decisions

| Item-ID | Origin-ID | Kind | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| decision-3254e0e540e5c41dcb3b38e8 | origin-b22132f6aa5678840b05cd1a | decision | accepted | Keep Uris Pool as an independently validated Recreation facility while presenting it only as the fifth Dodge View spaces row. |
| risk-4cefa7fe5f7f892d652e8f4a | origin-b22132f6aa5678840b05cd1a | risk | open | The full suite retains four pre-existing Recreation view expectation failures; the strict repository-backed decision audit also reports an older commit unreachable from this branch, while the history-independent ledger audit passes. |
